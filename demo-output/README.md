# MPCM-Pro Demo App

This Next.js application was created by **MPCM-Pro** to demonstrate multi-service orchestration.

## What Happened

MPCM-Pro orchestrated multiple services to create this complete application:

1. **Filesystem Service**: Created directories and files
2. **Git Service**: Initialized repository and made commits  
3. **Workflow Engine**: Managed dependencies and execution order

## Key Features Demonstrated

- ✅ Multi-service coordination
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Real file and git operations
- ✅ Complete app generation

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## The MPCM-Pro Difference

Instead of managing separate MCP servers manually, MPCM-Pro provides:
- **Unified orchestration** across all services
- **Workflow automation** with dependency resolution
- **Context preservation** across service calls
- **Error recovery** and graceful degradation
