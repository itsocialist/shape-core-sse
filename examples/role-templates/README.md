## How to Use These Templates

Templates are imported directly in your Claude conversation. There's no separate installation process.

### Method 1: Import via MCP Tool
```bash
# In Claude, copy the template content and say:
"Import this role template: <paste the JSON content from any template file>"

# Or be more specific:
"Import the security engineer role template"
# Then paste the content when Claude asks
```

### Method 2: Import with Custom ID
```bash
# Override the template's ID during import
"Import this template but call it 'my-security-role' instead"
# Then paste the template JSON
```

### Method 3: Create Based on Template
```bash
# Ask Claude to create a role based on a template
"Create a custom role like the security engineer template but focused more on cloud security"
```

## Creating Your Own Templates

A role template should include:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-role-id",              // Alphanumeric with dashes/underscores
  "name": "Display Name",              // Human-readable name
  "description": "Role description",    // Clear description of role's purpose
  "base_role_id": "developer",         // Optional: inherit from existing role
  "focus_areas": [                     // Areas this role concentrates on
    "area1",
    "area2"
  ],
  "default_tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],   // Tags auto-applied to contexts
  "preferred_context_types": [         // Types of context this role uses
    "decision",
    "code",
    "note"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Base Role**: Inherit from the role that most closely matches your needs
2. **Be Specific with Focus Areas**: Use 5-10 specific terms that describe the role's work
3. **Use Meaningful Tags**: Tags should help with searching and organization
4. **Select Appropriate Context Types**: Choose 3-5 types that the role uses most
