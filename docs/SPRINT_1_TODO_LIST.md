**Current Status:** 10 TypeScript errors, test failures detected

## 🔥 CRITICAL - MPM-101: Fix Build System (5 pts)
**Assignee:** Senior Engineer  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING

### TypeScript ES Module Import Fixes
- [ ] Fix ServiceAdapter.ts import: Change './types' to './types.js' (line 7)
- [ ] Fix TerminalAdapter.ts imports: Add .js extensions (lines 10, 11)
  - './base/ServiceAdapter' → './base/ServiceAdapter.js'
  - './base/types' → './base/types.js'

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully with zero errors
- [ ] All TypeScript import paths use proper ES module syntax
- [ ] Build process completes in <30 seconds
- [ ] All team members can build locally

## 🔥 CRITICAL - MPM-102: Complete Service Adapter Interfaces (8 pts)
**Assignee:** Senior Engineer  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING

### GitAdapter Missing shutdown() Method
- [ ] Add shutdown() method to GitAdapter class (src/adapters/GitAdapter.ts)
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup logic (close connections, release resources)
- [ ] Ensure method matches BaseAdapter interface signature
- [ ] Add error handling for shutdown failures

### TerminalAdapter Type Safety Issues  
- [ ] Fix 'result.content' unknown types in TerminalAdapter.ts (5 locations):
  - Line 197: Cast or validate result.content type
  - Line 274: Cast or validate result.content type  
  - Line 306: Cast or validate result.content type
  - Line 362: Cast or validate result.content type
  - Line 409: Cast or validate result.content type

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GitAdapter implements missing `shutdown()` method
- [ ] TerminalAdapter type issues resolved
- [ ] All adapters pass interface compliance tests
- [ ] Service registry can instantiate all adapters

## 🔥 CRITICAL - MPM-103: Repair Test Suite (8 pts)
**Assignee:** QA Engineer + Senior Engineer  
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING

### MCP Integration Test Framework
- [ ] Fix TerminalAdapter test failures - MCP tool name mismatch
- [ ] Update test expectations: 'execute_command' vs 'desktop_mcp:execute_command'
- [ ] Repair MCP mock configuration for integration tests
- [ ] Ensure all adapter tests pass with >90% success rate
- [ ] Optimize test performance and reliability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] >90% test pass rate (currently 60%)
- [ ] MCP integration tests working
- [ ] Adapter tests functional
- [ ] Test execution time <5 minutes

## 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY - MPM-104: Enhanced Context Persistence (8 pts)
**Assignee:** AI/ML Engineer  
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH

### Context Memory Improvements
- [ ] Implement context validation algorithms
- [ ] Add session recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create context repair for corrupted data
- [ ] Build retention accuracy measurement tools
- [ ] Optimize context storage performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Context retention validated at 95% accuracy
- [ ] Session recovery works after interruption
- [ ] Context validation and repair mechanisms active
- [ ] Performance impact <50ms per operation

## 📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY - MPM-105: Role-Specific Context Filtering (5 pts)
**Assignee:** AI/ML Engineer  
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH

### Context Filtering Implementation
- [ ] Design context relevance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Implement role-based filtering logic
- [ ] Create context quality measurement tools
- [ ] Optimize filtering performance
- [ ] Add context noise detection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Roles receive only relevant context (<5% noise)
- [ ] Context relevance scoring implemented
- [ ] Filter performance <100ms
- [ ] Context quality metrics tracked

## ✅ VERIFICATION TASKS
### Build Health
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - should complete with 0 errors
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` - should pass cleanly
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` - should pass with no warnings

### Test Health  
- [ ] Run `npm test` - should achieve >90% pass rate  
- [ ] Run `npm run test:integration` - should pass
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` - should maintain >85% coverage

### Interface Compliance
- [ ] Verify all adapters implement complete BaseAdapter interface
- [ ] Confirm service registry can instantiate all adapters
- [ ] Test adapter lifecycle methods (startup, shutdown)

## 📋 DAILY STANDUP TRACKING

### Sprint Progress Tracking
- **Day 1:** Import fixes completion
- **Day 2:** Interface implementation start
- **Day 3:** GitAdapter shutdown method
- **Day 4:** TerminalAdapter type fixes
- **Day 5:** Test framework repair start
- **Day 6:** MCP integration fixes
- **Day 7:** Context enhancement start
- **Day 8:** Context validation implementation
- **Day 9:** Role filtering implementation
- **Day 10:** Integration testing & validation
- **Day 11:** Performance optimization
- **Day 12:** Documentation updates
- **Day 13:** Final testing & bug fixes
- **Day 14:** Sprint review preparation

## 🛠 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### TDD Process (MANDATORY)
1. **Write Test First** - Define expected behavior
2. **Run Test** - Confirm it fails as expected
3. **Write Minimal Code** - Just enough to pass
4. **Run All Tests** - Ensure no regressions
5. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
6. **Commit** - Small, focused commits

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit:** TypeScript compilation + lint
- **Pre-push:** Full test suite
- **CI/CD:** Build + test + performance validation
- **Daily:** Build health + test coverage reports

## 📝 NOTES & BEST PRACTICES

### Architecture Decisions
- Document any changes to adapter interfaces
- Record rationale for type safety fixes
- Track performance impact of context changes

### Risk Mitigation
- Make incremental changes
- Test each fix in isolation
- Maintain rollback capability
- Pair programming on complex issues

### Success Metrics
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- >90% test suite pass rate
- <5% context noise in role filtering
- 95% context retention accuracy
- <100ms adapter operation performance
