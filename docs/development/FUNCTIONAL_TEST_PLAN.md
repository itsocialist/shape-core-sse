# üö® CRITICAL QA ASSESSMENT: Functional Testing Gap

## Current Testing Status: INSUFFICIENT FOR RELEASE

### What We've Done:
- ‚úÖ Unit tests (partial pass)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests (technical level)
- ‚úÖ Performance baselines
- ‚ùå **NO functional/user testing**
- ‚ùå **NO Claude Desktop testing**
- ‚ùå **NO grey box testing**
- ‚ùå **NO user acceptance testing**

## FUNCTIONAL TEST PLAN - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE v0.3.0

### 1. Installation & Setup Testing
- [ ] Fresh install via npm
- [ ] Upgrade from v0.2.x
- [ ] Claude Desktop configuration
- [ ] Database initialization
- [ ] Mode selection (Pro/Basic)

### 2. Core Functionality Testing (Basic Mode)
- [ ] Create new project
- [ ] Store context (all types)
- [ ] Search context
- [ ] List projects
- [ ] Update project status
- [ ] Switch roles
- [ ] Create role handoff
- [ ] Delete operations (v0.3.1 features)

### 3. Pro Mode Functionality Testing
- [ ] All Basic mode features
- [ ] Service registration
- [ ] Execute filesystem operations
- [ ] Execute Git operations
- [ ] Multi-service orchestration
- [ ] Role-based execution
- [ ] End-to-end app builder

### 4. Claude Desktop Integration Testing
- [ ] Tool discovery
- [ ] Tool execution
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Response formatting
- [ ] Context persistence
- [ ] Mode switching

### 5. User Workflows (Grey Box)
- [ ] Developer workflow: Code ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Deploy
- [ ] Product Manager workflow: Requirements ‚Üí Handoff
- [ ] Architect workflow: Design ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Handoff
- [ ] Team collaboration: Multiple roles, handoffs
- [ ] Project lifecycle: Create ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Archive

### 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid inputs
- [ ] Missing dependencies
- [ ] Corrupted database
- [ ] Service failures
- [ ] Network issues
- [ ] Large data sets
- [ ] Concurrent operations

### 7. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Existing projects load
- [ ] Old database migration
- [ ] Tool compatibility
- [ ] No data loss

### 8. Performance Under Load
- [ ] 1000+ contexts
- [ ] Multiple projects
- [ ] Rapid tool calls
- [ ] Memory usage over time

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Manual Functional Testing (4-6 hours)
1. Set up test environment
2. Create test scenarios
3. Execute core workflows
4. Document issues

### Phase 2: Claude Desktop Testing (2-3 hours)
1. Configure Claude Desktop
2. Test all 25 tools
3. Test mode switching
4. Verify user experience

### Phase 3: Fix Critical Issues (4-6 hours)
1. P0: Blocking issues
2. P1: Major functionality
3. P2: Quality of life

### Phase 4: Regression Testing (2 hours)
1. Re-run core scenarios
2. Verify fixes
3. Check performance

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Experience
```
1. Install mpcm-pro
2. Configure Claude Desktop
3. Create first project
4. Store some context
5. Search for context
6. Switch roles
```

### Scenario 2: Existing User Upgrade
```
1. Have v0.2.x installed
2. Upgrade to v0.3.0
3. Verify existing data
4. Test new features
5. Ensure nothing broke
```

### Scenario 3: Team Collaboration
```
1. PM creates requirements
2. Architect designs system
3. Developer implements
4. Handoffs between roles
5. Context accumulation
```

### Scenario 4: Pro Mode Power User
```
1. Create complex project
2. Use all services
3. Orchestrate workflow
4. Git operations
5. Template usage
```

## Release Criteria

### MUST HAVE for v0.3.0:
- [ ] All core tools work in Claude Desktop
- [ ] No data loss on upgrade
- [ ] Mode switching works
- [ ] No crashes/hangs
- [ ] Error messages helpful
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### SHOULD HAVE:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples working
- [ ] Smooth UX

### Known Issues (document if not fixed):
- [ ] TypeScript build warnings
- [ ] Some unit tests failing
- [ ] Git adapter import issues

## QA Sign-off Checklist

Before I can sign off on v0.3.0:
- [ ] Functional test plan executed
- [ ] Critical issues fixed
- [ ] Claude Desktop verified
- [ ] Upgrade path tested
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation accurate
- [ ] Known issues documented

## Current Risk Assessment: HIGH üî¥

We cannot release v0.3.0 without functional testing. The consolidation was a major change and we have zero evidence it works in real usage.
