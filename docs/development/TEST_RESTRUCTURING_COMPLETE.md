# MPCM-Pro Test Restructuring Complete

## Date: June 24, 2025
## Developer: Assistant completing test restructuring

## Summary
Successfully implemented the MCP adapter testing pattern with dependency injection across GitAdapter and TerminalAdapter. All tests are now passing and the pattern is ready for broader adoption.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Implemented Dependency Injection Pattern âœ…
Both GitAdapter and TerminalAdapter now support constructor injection of MCP client/transport:
```typescript
constructor(options?: AdapterOptions) {
  if (options?.mcpClient && options?.mcpTransport) {
    this.mcpClient = options.mcpClient;
    this.mcpTransport = options.mcpTransport;
    this.injectedClient = true;
  }
}
```

### 2. Created Comprehensive Test Helper âœ…
File: `tests/helpers/mcp-test-helper.ts`
- Mock creation utilities
- Dual-mode testing support (mocked vs real)
- Response builders for consistent mocking
- Environment-based test switching

### 3. Rewrote All Adapter Tests âœ…
**GitAdapter**: 20/20 tests passing
- Unit tests with mocks
- Integration tests ready (when USE_REAL_MCP=true)
- Complete coverage of all Git operations

**TerminalAdapter**: 18/18 tests passing
- Fixed session tracking logic
- Fixed cleanup method for proper mocking
- Full command execution coverage

### 4. Fixed Critical Issues âœ…
- Restored corrupted TerminalAdapter.ts file (was only 23 lines)
- Created missing ServiceAdapter.ts base class
- Fixed session tracking to detect "continues running" commands
- Fixed cleanup to call MCP tools directly for testability

## Test Execution

### Running Unit Tests (Default - Fast)
```bash
npm test -- tests/adapters/GitAdapter.test.ts
npm test -- tests/adapters/TerminalAdapter.test.ts
```

### Running Integration Tests (With Real MCP)
```bash
USE_REAL_MCP=true npm test -- tests/adapters/GitAdapter.test.ts
USE_REAL_MCP=true npm test -- tests/adapters/TerminalAdapter.test.ts
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Fast Tests**: Unit tests run in <300ms vs >5s with real MCP
2. **Reliable Tests**: No flaky failures from external dependencies
3. **Better Coverage**: Can test error scenarios impossible with real servers
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests can run in any environment without MCP setup
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between adapter logic and integration

## Pattern Ready for Rollout

The pattern is now proven and documented. Next adapters to update:
- FilesystemAdapter
- Any future MCP service adapters

## Files Created/Modified
- âœ… `/tests/helpers/mcp-test-helper.ts` (created)
- âœ… `/src/adapters/GitAdapter.ts` (added DI support)
- âœ… `/src/adapters/TerminalAdapter.ts` (added DI support + restored from corruption)
- âœ… `/src/adapters/base/ServiceAdapter.ts` (created)
- âœ… `/tests/adapters/GitAdapter.test.ts` (complete rewrite)
- âœ… `/tests/adapters/TerminalAdapter.test.ts` (complete rewrite)
- âœ… `/docs/testing/mcp-adapter-testing-pattern.md` (created)

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check file integrity before making changes
2. Mock at the boundaries (MCP client level) not internal methods
3. Support both mocked and real testing for confidence
4. Keep test helpers focused and reusable
5. Document patterns immediately for team adoption

## Ready for QA! ðŸŽ‰
The test restructuring is complete and all adapter tests are passing. The codebase is now ready for full system testing and eventual release.
