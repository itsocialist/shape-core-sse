# MPCM-Pro v0.3.2 Release Notes
*Released: July 1, 2025*

## üóÇÔ∏è Deletion Tools & Directory Cleanup

This release introduces comprehensive data management tools for maintaining clean, organized project environments.

## üöÄ New Features

### Deletion Tools Suite
- **`delete_project`** - Permanently delete projects with all associated data
  - Removes project metadata, contexts, role assignments, and handoffs
  - Confirmation required to prevent accidental deletions
  - Complete cleanup ensures no orphaned data

- **`delete_context`** - Delete specific context entries
  - Targeted removal of individual context items
  - Supports both project-scoped and shared context deletion
  - Maintains referential integrity

- **`cleanup_old_data`** - Time-based batch cleanup
  - Remove data older than specified time periods
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes before execution
  - Configurable time thresholds (days, weeks, months, years)

### Enhanced Directory Management
- **Project Directory Cleanup** - Automated organization of project structures
- **Comprehensive Data Operations** - Streamlined data management workflows
- **Safety Mechanisms** - Multiple confirmation layers for destructive operations

## üìä Multi-Role Validation Study
