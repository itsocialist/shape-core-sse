# Release Notes - v0.2.0

## üéâ New Major Feature: Role-Based Context Management

This release introduces **role-based features** that enable Claude to adopt different perspectives when working on your projects. Each role comes with specialized focus areas, default tags, and context templates.

### üé≠ Default Roles

- **Software Architect** - System design, architecture decisions, and technical standards
- **Software Developer** - Implementation, code patterns, debugging, and feature development  
- **DevOps Engineer** - Deployment, infrastructure, monitoring, and CI/CD
- **QA Engineer** - Testing, quality assurance, bug tracking, and test planning
- **Product Manager** - Requirements, user stories, priorities, and roadmap

### üöÄ Key Features

#### Role Management
- **List available roles** - View all default and custom roles with their configurations
- **Switch active role** - Change perspective for a project to focus on role-specific tasks
- **Get active role** - Check which role is currently active for decision-making
- **Create custom roles** - Define your own roles with custom templates and focus areas

#### Role-Aware Context
- Context entries can now be associated with specific roles
- Filter context by role to see only relevant information
- Automatic role context when storing entries while a role is active
- Backward compatible - existing contexts work without roles

#### Role Handoffs
- Create structured handoffs between roles
- Document key decisions, pending tasks, and important context
- Track handoff history for project continuity
- Include warnings and blockers for the next role

3. **`switch_role`** - Switch to a different role for focused work
4. **`create_custom_role`** - Create a new custom role
5. **`create_role_handoff`** - Create a handoff between roles

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Enhanced Type Safety** - Improved TypeScript types for role-related operations
- **Better Error Handling** - More informative error messages for role operations
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 148 tests including role-specific scenarios

await storeContext({
  project_name: "my-app",
  type: "decision",
  key: "database-choice",
  value: "PostgreSQL for scalability"
});

// Create a handoff to developer
await createRoleHandoff({
  project_name: "my-app",
  to_role_id: "developer",
  handoff_data: {
    summary: "Architecture phase complete",
    keyDecisions: ["PostgreSQL", "Microservices"],
    pendingTasks: ["Implement user service"],
    warnings: ["Database connection pooling needed"]
  }
