# DevOps Status Report - MCP Server Setup

## Date: June 24, 2025
## DevOps Engineer: Assistant
## Status: Partially Complete - Issues Found and Fixed

## What I've Done

### 1. Installed MCP Servers ‚úÖ
- **Git MCP Server**: `@cyanheads/git-mcp-server` (installed globally)
- **Desktop Commander**: `@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander` (installed globally)

### 2. Fixed Critical Issues ‚úÖ
- **Package Name Mismatch**: Code expected `@modelcontextprotocol/server-git` which doesn't exist
  - Fixed: Updated GitAdapter to use `@cyanheads/git-mcp-server`
- **Tool Name Mismatch**: Code expected `desktop_mcp:execute_command` format
  - Fixed: Removed `desktop_mcp:` prefix from all tool calls

### 3. Integration Test Results üìä

#### Before Fixes:
- 0 passing
- 9 skipped
- Multiple connection failures

#### After Fixes:
- **5 passing** ‚úÖ
  - Git MCP: Connect test, Error handling test
  - Terminal: Connect test, Execute commands test
- **4 failing** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Git workflow and branch operations (partial failures)
  - Terminal working directory and command checking
- **38 skipped** (unit tests in integration mode)

## Technical Details

### Git MCP Server
```bash
# Installed: @cyanheads/git-mcp-server
# Location: /Users/briandawson/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.2/bin/git-mcp-server
# 25 tools available including all standard git operations
```

### Desktop Commander
```bash
# Installed: @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
# Access via: npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
# 18 tools available for file/terminal operations
```

## CI/CD Recommendations

### 1. Update Package References
```yaml
# In CI/CD scripts, use these packages:
npm install -g @cyanheads/git-mcp-server
npm install -g @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
export USE_REAL_MCP=true
export MCP_TEST_TIMEOUT=30000
export PATH=$PATH:$(npm bin -g)  # Ensure global npm bins are in PATH
```

### 3. Test Execution Strategy
```yaml
# Separate jobs for unit and integration tests
test:unit:
  script:
    - npm test  # Fast, no MCP needed

test:integration:
  script:
    - npm install -g @cyanheads/git-mcp-server @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
    - USE_REAL_MCP=true npm test -- tests/adapters/*.test.ts
  allow_failure: true  # While we fix remaining issues
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Git MCP Partial Failures
- Some git operations failing in complex workflows
- May need repository initialization or permissions

### 2. Terminal Working Directory
- `cd` command handling might need adjustment
- Path resolution issues possible

### 3. Command Detection
- `which` command format might need tweaking

## Recommendations

1. **For Development Team**:
   - Review failing tests and adjust expectations
   - Consider if test assumptions match actual MCP behavior
   - Update documentation with correct package names

2. **For QA Team**:
   - Can begin testing with 5/9 integration tests passing
   - Focus on core functionality that's working
   - Document specific failures for dev team

3. **For CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Implement staged rollout
   - Keep integration tests non-blocking initially
   - Monitor test stability over time

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ MCP servers are installed and partially working
2. ‚è≥ Development team should review failing tests
3. üîú QA can begin limited integration testing
4. üìã Create tickets for remaining test failures

## Summary
The MCP server infrastructure is **operational but not fully compatible** with test expectations. Core functionality is working, allowing development to proceed while specific issues are resolved.
