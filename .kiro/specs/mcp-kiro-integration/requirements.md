# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes reliable MCP connectivity between the deployed Ship APE Core SSE server (currently running on Railway at https://ship-ape-sse-production.up.railway.app) and Kiro's MCP integration system. The primary goal is to enable seamless testing and usage of Ship APE's 25+ role-based development tools through Claude Desktop via Kiro, resolving current connectivity issues and establishing a robust testing workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want to connect to the deployed Ship APE Core SSE server through MCP configuration, so that I can access all 25+ Ship APE tools directly within Claude Desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure Kiro's MCP settings with the Railway-deployed Ship APE server THEN the connection SHALL be established successfully
2. WHEN the MCP connection is active THEN all Ship APE tools SHALL appear in Claude Desktop's available tools list
3. WHEN I execute Ship APE MCP tools THEN the system SHALL communicate with the Railway deployment and return proper responses
4. WHEN connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating whether the issue is authentication, network, or server-side

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Ship APE user, I want to test the deployed server's MCP tools through Kiro, so that I can validate all functionality works correctly in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test core Ship APE tools (store_project_context, search_context, list_projects) THEN the system SHALL execute successfully against the Railway database
2. WHEN I test role management tools (switch_role, create_role_handoff, list_roles) THEN the system SHALL maintain role state correctly
3. WHEN I test advanced tools (execute_as_role, git_operation) THEN the system SHALL handle complex orchestration workflows
4. WHEN tools encounter errors THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper tenant authentication and API key management for the deployed Ship APE server, so that MCP connections are secure and properly isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting through MCP THEN the system SHALL use proper API key authentication with the Railway deployment
2. WHEN multiple users connect THEN the system SHALL maintain proper tenant isolation using the multi-tenant architecture
3. WHEN API keys are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL reject connections with clear authentication error messages
4. WHEN tenant data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper database isolation and security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing Ship APE integration, I want comprehensive MCP tool validation within Kiro, so that I can verify all 25+ tools work correctly with the deployed server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running MCP tool tests THEN the system SHALL validate successful execution of all core context management tools
2. WHEN testing role orchestration THEN the system SHALL verify role switching, handoffs, and context preservation work correctly
3. WHEN testing service integration THEN the system SHALL confirm git operations and filesystem tools function properly
4. WHEN generating test reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed results showing which tools passed/failed and why

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Ship APE user, I want seamless role-based development workflows through the MCP connection, so that I can leverage the full power of the AI development team from Claude Desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch to architect role THEN the system SHALL change context and provide architecture-focused assistance
2. WHEN I create role handoffs THEN the system SHALL store handoff information in the Railway database and make it available to other roles
3. WHEN I store project context THEN the system SHALL persist information to the deployed database with proper project association
4. WHEN I search for context THEN the system SHALL return relevant results from the centralized Railway database

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer configuring MCP integration, I want clear setup instructions and troubleshooting guidance, so that I can quickly establish and maintain the Ship APE connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the MCP connection THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step configuration instructions for Kiro
2. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL offer diagnostic tools to identify network, authentication, or server problems
3. WHEN tools fail to execute THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL support connection testing and validation before saving changes
