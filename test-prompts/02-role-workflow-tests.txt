I'm starting to design the architecture for my new e-commerce project
I've decided to use PostgreSQL and Redis for the backend
I'm done with the design phase, time to start coding
What did the architect decide about the database?
I need to deploy this to AWS next week
Let me hand this off to QA for testing
What should the DevOps engineer know about this project?
