# Complex Multi-Step Workflow Tests
# Tests that require multiple tool calls and maintain context
# Each section is a complete workflow - run all prompts in sequence

## Workflow 1: Complete Project Lifecycle
I'm starting a new mobile app project called HealthTracker
The main goal is to help users track their daily medications  
As the architect, I think we should use React Native
We'll need push notifications for medication reminders
I'm ready to hand this off to development
As a developer, what architecture decisions were made?
I've implemented the basic reminder system
Time to test this - switching to QA role
What features need testing based on the requirements?

## Workflow 2: Debugging Scenario  
Something is wrong with our authentication system
Users are reporting they get logged out randomly
As a developer, I found it happens after 5 minutes of inactivity
This might be a token expiration issue
Let me document this for the team
What other authentication issues have we seen before?

## Workflow 3: Sprint Planning
Let's plan the next sprint for the HealthTracker project
Show me all the pending tasks
What did QA report as issues?
What features are still in the architect's backlog?
Create a summary of work for the next two weeks
